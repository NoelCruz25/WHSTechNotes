The challenges we encountered when doing the maze was trying to get the lines perfect, it was hard to do it and we couldn't make it straight. To overcome or resolve this problem, we used a ruler to make straight lines and we used the inches on the ruler to see how long our lines would be. I made a few mistakes because I messed up some of the lines and I wasn't accurate. I learned from my mistake and was able to make the line perfectly, learning from mistakes is good because you can practice to do better.

We approched programming the Sphero by putting exactly 2-3 codes, Putting delay's and the time, speed and distance code. The delay stops the ball for a second so that the Sphero doesn't move around a whole bunch. We delay it so it doesn't move around in one big line and leave the maze, we want it in the maze and following the path. We set the speed not to high so that it doesn't leave the maze path, we set it to about 40 to 50 speed. Every time, speed and distance code is placed we put a delay code below it, this is to make it delay after the time, speed and distance code is finished. Lastly, the adjustments we needed to make was changing the time so that we could perfectly make it accurate after each stop.

The Hour of Code activity I completed was the Create a T-Rex Game. The thing I found interesting about the game was the coding part, I was able to make the T-Rex jump and walk to the coins. Some difficulties I had with the activity was that I had a bit of trouble coding the game and I got a bit stuck. I watched the video again and was able to do the code and made the T-Rex jump. Other then that I went through all the steps easy peasy like taking candy from a baby. Some other things I found interesting was I was able to make noise while coding the jump to the T-Rex. Another thing is that there is a theme in the background that is the tetris theme. Other stuff that was interesting was I was able to code a whole game over screen and I think that's really cool. Another thing is that I was able to change the dino's color and the ocean and sky color, I really like the texture of it and the many colors it comes in. Another interesting thing is that I was able to program obstacles which were cactusis and when I hit them it gave me a game over screen.

What I found more easier to use is CodeCombat, the reason why is because on CodeCombat you can learn more about how to code. On codeCombat it's easier because all you need to do is type some words and your character will move. Sphero helped me solve coding challenges because there are guides to help you along the way. On CodeCombat there is an option that will give you hints, it will give you steps and help you code and fight enemies. I had more flexibility in CodeCombat because there was so much to do, there was so many options to choose from and you had abilities. Python can be more useful because it gives you more options on coding and how to do them.
