The challenges we encountered when doing the maze was trying to get the lines perfect, it was hard to do it and we couldn't make it straight. To overcome or resolve this problem, we used a ruler to make straight lines and we used the inches on the ruler to see how long our lines would be. I made a few mistakes because I messed up some of the lines and I wasn't accurate. I learned from my mistake and was able to make the line perfectly, learning from mistakes is good because you can practice to do better.

We approched programming the Sphero by putting exactly 2-3 codes, Putting delay's and the time, speed and distance code. The delay stops the ball for a second so that the Sphero doesn't move around a whole bunch. We delay it so it doesn't move around in one big line and leave the maze, we want it in the maze and following the path. We set the speed not to high so that it doesn't leave the maze path, we set it to about 40 to 50 speed. Every time, speed and distance code is placed we put a delay code below it, this is to make it delay after the time, speed and distance code is finished. Lastly, the adjustments we needed to make was changing the time so that we could perfectly make it accurate after each stop.
